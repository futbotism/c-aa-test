# Clipboard test


- This test was a fun challenge, i added in automatically generated colors for something abit different
- I opted not to use any state so i could keep it simple and barebones, although the basic premise of subscriptions are used.
- I opted not to use any css libraries again to keep it simple and basic, although things are aligned correctly and some style sugar would make it appear like a real application
- I ran out of time to add tests unfortunately, but i did split up the state file into a bunch of simple functions which would make testing much easier.
- If i wanted to further develop this into a real application i would add leaderboards, shared & core modules redux and those surrounding pattern which greatly enhance application architecture.
- If i had more time i would have finished off the difficulty selector, to see how this would have worked you can change the `root` to an even number lower or higher in line 26 of `state.service.ts`
